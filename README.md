# peertorrent
A bad (no really, it's like a torrent client but really bad) torrent client for a school project of mine

# windows users
you will not be able to run this lol, libtorrent installs perfectly on linux, but not on windows.  
you will have to use a virtual machine, preferably ubuntu or debian based, to install python3-libtorrent and libtorrent-rasterbar
